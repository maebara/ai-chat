you should be able to add a initial chat text, then the conversation is autocompleted.

you must add your own api key.

`properties.json`

```json
  {
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY", //put your api key here
      "initial_text" : "You: What have you been up to?\nFriend: Watching old movies.\nYou: Did you watch anything interesting?\nFriend:" // initial chat status 
  }
```
